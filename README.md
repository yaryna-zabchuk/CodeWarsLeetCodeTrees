# CodeWarsLeetCodeTrees

This repository contains solutions to binary tree-related problems that are part of the homework for the "Introduction to Programming" course. All problems are implemented in Python and demonstrate various aspects of working with binary trees, such as traversal, sorting, and node removal.

## 1. Sort Binary Tree by Levels

- **File**: [`Sort_binary_tree_by_levels/solution.py`](Sort_binary_tree_by_levels/solution.py)
- **Description**: 
  Implementation of a function for level-order traversal of a binary tree. The function returns a list of node values in level order.

## 2. Delete Node in a BST

- **File**: [`Delete_Node_in_a_BST/solution.py`](Delete_Node_in_a_BST/solution.py)
- **Description**: 
  Implementation of a function to delete a node from a binary search tree (BST). The function handles three main cases:

    * The node is a leaf.

    * The node has one child.

    * The node has two children.

## 3. Binary Tree Traversal

- **File**: [`Binary_Tree_Traversal/solution.py`](Binary_Tree_Traversal/solution.py)
- **Description**: 
  Implementation of three types of binary tree traversal:

    * Pre-order (root-left-right)

    * In-order (left-root-right)

    * Post-order (left-right-root)
